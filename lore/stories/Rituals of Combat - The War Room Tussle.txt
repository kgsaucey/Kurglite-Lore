Rituals of Combat - The War Room Tussle
The heavy door of the war room creaked ominously as it swung shut, sealing the world outside. Within the fortified walls, the atmosphere shifted from the weighty seriousness of command to something far more mischievous. Primarch Kurgle, Brother Slickback, and Brother Goose found themselves unburdened by the demands of leadership, free to revel in the camaraderie that often lay dormant beneath the mantle of duty.
Without warning, Brother Slickback lunged forward, tackling Kurgle to the ground with a force that would have shattered lesser beings. The Primarch barely had time to react before his massive frame crashed against the cold stone floor, the resounding impact echoing through the chamber. Slickback's dark purple gauntlet clamped down on Kurgle's shoulder, pressing with surprising strength for such a spontaneous assault.
Kurgle squirmed beneath the weight, his amphibian-like eyes wide with a mix of annoyance and amusement. “Get the hell off me!” he barked, his voice gruff, though laughter lurked behind the demand.
Before Slickback could respond, Brother Goose, ever the opportunist, launched himself into the air with an exaggerated squawk. He descended in a chaotic rush, his taloned feet colliding with Kurgle’s side in a full-force dropkick. The impact knocked the wind from the Primarch’s lungs, sending him into a breathless fit of laughter.
“Motherfuckers!” Kurgle gasped, struggling to regain his composure as he writhed beneath the weight of his companions.
Goose, his beak twitching into what passed for a grin, quipped, “Can’t take a little kick, can you, bitch?” He rolled away, wings flaring briefly as he prepared to pounce once more.
Meanwhile, Slickback, quick to capitalize on the chaos, struck again. He rose to a half-crouch, adopting a faux-serious stance before delivering a sharp jab to Kurgle’s midsection. “YOU DON'T WANT THIS SMOKE!” he taunted, his voice booming with mock bravado. The blow sent Kurgle reeling back, his hands instinctively flying up to block the next attack.
But Kurgle, ever the warrior, was not so easily bested. With a growl that rumbled through the war room, he launched himself at Slickback, the sheer momentum of his charge lifting the Honor Guard off his feet. They collided in a fierce grapple, armor scraping against armor as they rolled across the floor, each trying to gain the upper hand. Kurgle’s massive hands clamped down on Slickback’s shoulders, attempting to pin him while avoiding a counterstrike.
“Get off me!” Slickback shrieked, his voice erupting into a loud, high-pitched scream that echoed through the chamber, startling even Kurgle for a moment. But his exaggerated, girlish outburst was quickly betrayed by the wide grin plastered on his face, unable to fully mask the thrill of the struggle.

Goose, still recovering from his earlier leap, saw his opportunity. With a shrill honk, he flung himself at the pair, aiming to topple both warriors in one chaotic sweep. The impact sent all three crashing to the floor in a tangle of limbs and clattering armor, their laughter filling the chamber as they fought for dominance.
In the midst of the tussle, a stray fist caught Kurgle in the ribs, drawing an exaggerated “Oof!” from the Primarch. His eyes widened in mock indignation. “You sneaky fuck!” he exclaimed, before diving back into the fray with renewed vigor.
For what seemed like hours, the war room was alive with the sounds of clashing armor, grunts, and the occasional burst of laughter. The mighty warriors, who had faced countless battles across the stars, now found themselves locked in a struggle cuddle, the weight of their responsibilities momentarily forgotten.
Eventually, exhaustion began to creep in, and the chaotic whirlwind of punches and kicks slowed. The three warriors lay sprawled on the floor, their breath coming in ragged gasps, still chuckling at the absurdity of their situation.
Just as they began to regain their composure, the heavy door creaked open once more. Luna, her posture radiating both authority and exasperation, stepped into the room. Her sharp gaze swept across the scene—armor dented, warriors breathless, the once orderly war room now a scene of barely contained chaos.
“What in the Emperor’s name is going on in here?” she demanded, hands in a textbook knife-hand position. Her voice carried the weight of both disbelief and the expectation that they would answer for this absurd display.
Kurgle, still catching his breath, exchanged a sheepish glance with Slickback and Goose, a grin tugging at the corners of his wide mouth. “Uh, just a little… combat exercise, Luna,” he offered, his froggish voice tinged with laughter.
Luna’s eyes narrowed, her lips pressed into a thin line. “Combat exercise?” she repeated, incredulous. “This is a war chamber, not a playground! Get it together!”
With that, she turned sharply on her heel, her armored boots clicking against the stone as she strode out of the room. Kurgle, Slickback, and Goose scrambled to their feet, hastily straightening their armor as the seriousness of their roles began to settle back upon their shoulders.
Just as Kurgle finished adjusting his armor, Goose shifted forward, his movements quick and mischievous. With an exaggerated flourish, he slapped the Primarch square in the side of his helmet, the loud thwack echoing in the chamber. Kurgle’s eyes flared with shock and fury, but before he could react, Goose had already bolted for the door, his honking laughter trailing behind him as he made his hasty exit.
Slickback snickered as Kurgle, momentarily stunned, clenched his fists in frustration. “That motherfucker,” Kurgle muttered, shaking his head with a mix of exasperation and amusement.
