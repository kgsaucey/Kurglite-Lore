The Massacre on Vostoria Prime
Vostoria Prime, once a thriving industrial world within the Imperium, had descended into chaos. Whispers of heretical cults devoted to Chaos spread across the planet like wildfire, igniting rebellion among the population. The Imperial forces stationed there had been overwhelmed, unable to suppress the growing tide of corruption. As the Chaos threat intensified, the planet stood on the brink of being consumed by darkness, threatening to become a staging ground for further incursions into nearby systems.
In a desperate plea for salvation, the surviving Imperial loyalists sent word to the Kurglites, hoping their brutal reputation would be enough to stem the rising tide. The response came not in the form of a fleet, but in the presence of a single man: Damian, the son of Primarch Kurgle, known as "The Silent Executor."
Damian had earned his fearsome title for his cold, methodical approach to warfare. Where others led armies, he often preferred to work alone, operating with terrifying precision and efficiency. His methods were feared even among the Kurglites, for Damian did not just defeat his enemies—he eradicated them entirely, leaving nothing but silence in his wake.
As Damian’s dropship descended through the murky atmosphere of Vostoria Prime, the planet’s surface came into view: a grim wasteland of twisted metal and smoke, with towering spires that once served as industrial hubs now standing as monuments to decay. Heretical banners fluttered in the polluted air, and Damian could sense the malevolent presence of Chaos thickening the atmosphere like a living thing.
When the dropship touched down on the surface, no welcoming party awaited him. There was no fanfare, no signs of hope. Vostoria Prime had already been written off by many within the Imperium, a lost cause not worth the effort to save. But for Damian, this was a task of honor—a mission to restore the Emperor’s light where it had been all but extinguished.
Clad in his dark green power armor, battle-scarred and worn from countless campaigns, Damian stepped out into the desolation. His helmet visor scanned the environment, picking up heat signatures and movement patterns in the distance. In his hand, he carried a crozius arcanum, a ceremonial weapon he had modified with deadly precision instruments—just one of the many enhancements he’d made to his equipment over the years. Around his waist, a belt of tech-tools glistened, each one designed for a specific purpose: sabotage, infiltration, or execution.
Damian’s mission was clear. He was to eradicate the heretical leadership of Vostoria Prime, the key figures who had led the planet into ruin and pledged themselves to Chaos. The death of these cult leaders would cripple the rebellion and prevent the world from becoming a gateway for a larger invasion. Unlike his sister Luna or Lieutenant Goose, who commanded armies in massive, tactical battles, Damian preferred his solitary campaigns. Here, on Vostoria Prime, he would strike from the shadows, executing his grim mission without hesitation.
The first target on his list was the Vox Spire, a massive communication tower that the cultists had repurposed to broadcast their blasphemous sermons across the planet. From there, the leaders of the rebellion incited their followers to defy the Emperor and embrace Chaos. Damian knew that silencing this tower would send a message—a very clear, very final message.
Moving through the industrial ruins with unnerving speed and stealth for a man of his size, Damian approached the tower under the cover of darkness. The streets around him were filled with the echoes of heretical chanting, and occasional groups of cultists patrolled the area. Damian engaged his cloaking system, a gift from his technological mastery, rendering him nearly invisible to the naked eye. His respirator mask hummed faintly as he bypassed the guards and scaled the tower’s exterior, using magnetic grapples to ascend quickly and undetected.
Reaching the top of the Vox Spire, Damian crouched near the broadcasting chamber. Inside, the cultist leaders were gathered, basking in their perceived victory. Their leader, a bloated figure adorned in chaotic sigils, was delivering a sermon to his acolytes, promising them eternal power in exchange for their devotion to the dark gods.
Damian did not hesitate. With a single, calculated movement, he overloaded the tower’s power core, plunging the entire spire into darkness. The cultists were thrown into confusion, scrambling for weapons and orders. But by the time they realized what was happening, it was already too late.
Damian moved through the chamber like a specter, his crozius arcanum smashing through the skulls of the heretical leaders with terrifying precision. Blood splattered across the walls, and the once-proud symbols of Chaos were defaced in moments. He eliminated them one by one, his silent, efficient strikes leaving no time for alarm or resistance. Within minutes, the leadership of the Vox Spire lay dead at his feet, their lifeless bodies a testament to the Silent Executor’s brutal efficiency.
With the tower silenced, Damian’s next objective was the heretical fortress where the remaining cult leaders had barricaded themselves. Unlike the surgical strike on the spire, this assault would require more than stealth. Damian needed to make an example of them, to show the people of Vostoria Prime that Chaos would not prevail.
Approaching the fortress under the cover of night, Damian employed his mastery of technology to disable the fortress’s defenses. Power systems, automated turrets, and life support systems all fell under his control. With the fortress now vulnerable, Damian deactivated its life support entirely, ensuring that the heretic leaders inside would suffocate in the darkness. As they scrambled to restore power and escape, Damian watched silently through his visor, calculating their every move.
Panic spread among the heretics as their final breaths were stolen from them. Some tried to flee, but Damian was waiting. He cut them down with ruthless precision, ensuring that none would live to spread their heresy. The fortress fell into complete silence, the bodies of the heretical leaders strewn across its halls like discarded puppets.
When the massacre was complete, Damian left behind a grim display. The bodies of the heretic leaders were impaled on the fortress’s highest spire, their disfigured corpses serving as a warning to any who dared to defy the Emperor’s will. The massacre on Vostoria Prime was swift, terrifying, and absolute. Damian had not just defeated the rebellion—he had erased it from existence.
As the Silent Executor departed the planet, the few remaining loyalists whispered his name with both awe and fear. Vostoria Prime was saved, but the cost of its salvation was a chilling reminder of the Kurglites’ ruthless efficiency. Damian, the son of Primarch Kurgle, had ensured that the light of the Emperor would continue to shine—though his methods left nothing but darkness in their wake.
