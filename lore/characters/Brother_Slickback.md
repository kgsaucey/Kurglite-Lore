## History
- **Service Record:**  
## History 
- Prior to the Rebellion of Kurgle against the Iron Maw, Benedictus Thane served in the Deathwatch. His actions before assuming the mantle of Black Shield remain undocumented.  

- Stationed upon a remote moon when the Horus Heresy erupted, Thane fought through a protracted campaign against xenos enemies, unaware of the galaxy-wide upheaval. When the conflict concluded, he attempted to return to the Deathwatch only to find the Imperium fractured and suspicion rampant.  

- Upon his return, Thane was placed on trial to test his loyalty. The tribunal itself was compromised by hidden heretics, and it was in this moment that Captain Kurgle was summoned in secret to investigate. Kurgle uncovered and slew the traitors embedded within the proceedings, but his intervention escalated the tribunal into open conflict with the Iron Maw.  

- The Iron Maw’s Chapter Master, already corrupted by treachery, censured Kurgle for his defiance. In the ensuing purge, Kurgle and his loyalists struck down the tribunal and citadel occupants, casting aside the corruption festering within their Chapter. In this upheaval, Thane—now Brother Slickback—was taken under Kurgle’s wing, binding his fate to the nascent Kurglite Rebellion.
