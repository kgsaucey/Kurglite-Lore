KURGLITE CHAPTER


[EVENTS]
[The Rebellion of Kurgle]
Primarch Kurgle, The Ascended, led a rebellion against the corrupted leadership of the Iron Maw Chapter, which had fallen to the worship of Khorne under the leadership of Vorthas the Devourer. The rebellion was swift and brutal, with Kurgle purging the Chapter of its heretical elements. After the defeat of Vorthas, Kurgle renamed the Chapter to the Kurglites, restoring their loyalty to the Emperor.

[Ambush on Glaurus IV]
While patrolling an alien shoreline, Primarch Kurgle, The Ascended, and Brother Slickback were ambushed by a river raptor Tyranid. With Kurgle’s back turned, Slickback tackled and killed the creature, reaffirming his role as Kurgle’s swift and deadly protector.




[HONOUR GUARD]
The Kurglite Honor Guard is an elite unit within the Chapter, tasked with protecting the Chapter’s most important assets and leaders, including Primarch Kurgle. The Honor Guard is composed of the most loyal and battle-hardened marines, chosen for their unwavering loyalty and effectiveness in battle.
Brother Slickback is a prominent figure within the Honor Guard, known for his brutal enforcement of discipline and his protective nature when it comes to the Chapter’s leadership. His swift reaction times and unparalleled combat efficiency make him one of Kurgle’s most trusted defenders. Brother Goose, with his unpredictable but powerful combat abilities, is also frequently deployed alongside the Honor Guard during high-risk missions.
The Honor Guard’s combat style emphasizes both defensive tactics and rapid counterattacks. While they specialize in holding critical positions, they are equally skilled at launching decisive strikes against threats. The combination of calculated defense and overwhelming offensive power makes the Kurglite Honor Guard one of the most feared units in the Chapter.

[TACTICS]
The Kurglite Chapter is known for its calculated approach to warfare, a direct reflection of Primarch Kurgle’s leadership. Unlike the reckless, bloodthirsty tactics of their predecessor, the Iron Maw, the Kurglites operate with discipline, precision, and strategic violence. The Chapter is revered for their ability to exploit their enemies’ weaknesses, dismantling opposing forces piece by piece.
Their tactics often revolve around siege warfare, a remnant of their original Chapter’s expertise, but with an added emphasis on calculated strikes. The Kurglites will often weaken enemy defenses over time, striking at opportune moments to deliver devastating blows. Primarch Kurgle insists on tactical patience, and his marines are trained to balance restraint with ruthlessness. While some units like Brother Goose excel in unbridled aggression, they are kept in check by the overarching strategy that Kurgle sets.
The Chapter is also known for their adaptability, with specialized units for various types of warfare, from shock assaults to long sieges. The Kurglite Honor Guard, in particular, is renowned for their defensive prowess, often tasked with protecting key assets and leadership figures, such as Kurgle himself.




[RELATIONS]
The relationships within the Kurglite Chapter are complex and often defined by mutual respect, discipline, and loyalty. However, differences in personality and combat styles among key figures create subtle tensions and alliances within the Chapter.
Primarch Kurgle and Luna
Luna’s relationship with her father, Primarch Kurgle, is based on mutual respect and a shared desire to see the Chapter thrive. While Kurgle respects Luna’s tactical prowess and ruthlessness in battle, he worries about her empathetic side. Her compassion toward her subordinates, though beneficial in fostering loyalty, is viewed by Kurgle as a potential weakness that could be exploited. Nonetheless, Luna remains a key tool of the Chapter, executing her father’s will with precision and unwavering focus during times of crisis.
Primarch Kurgle and Damian
Kurgle and his son Damian share a bond rooted in discipline and a shared appreciation for technology. Kurgle respects Damian’s unsettling efficiency and his role as overseer of the Dreadnoughts, trusting his son’s cold and calculated methods. Though Damian’s unnerving smile and curiosity toward violence have raised concerns within the Chapter, Kurgle acknowledges Damian’s value as a fearsome enforcer of Kurglite law. Their relationship, while not overtly emotional, is built on trust and mutual understanding of their roles within the Chapter.
Luna and Damian
Luna and Damian maintain a strong sibling bond, despite their contrasting personalities. Where Damian thrives on calculated brutality and a fascination with violence, Luna is more compassionate and empathetic toward those under her command. Despite their differences, they work together efficiently in battle, with Luna’s tactical mind complementing Damian’s ruthless execution of orders. Their mutual loyalty to their father, Primarch Kurgle, solidifies their relationship, even if they don’t always see eye to eye on the methods used to achieve victory.
Luna and Brother Goose
Luna shares a close bond with Brother Goose due to their mutual respect and understanding of each other’s differences. While Goose is driven by raw aggression and a more volatile combat style, Luna’s calm and calculated leadership often provides balance in their operations. Luna’s compassionate nature allows her to connect with Goose on a personal level, which makes their collaboration on the battlefield particularly effective. Despite this bond, Luna remains aware of Goose’s unpredictable nature, relying on his aggression only in the heat of battle.
Brother Slickback and Luna
Brother Slickback and Luna share a more strained relationship. While Slickback respects Luna’s ability as a commander, he views her empathetic side as a potential weakness. Slickback, a brutal enforcer of the Chapter’s discipline, sees no room for compassion when it comes to ensuring loyalty to Kurgle. However, despite their differences, both Slickback and Luna are fiercely loyal to the Primarch and work together when required. Their relationship is one of professional respect, but underlying tension exists due to their differing leadership styles.
Brother Slickback and Brother Goose
Slickback and Brother Goose share a relationship rooted in mutual respect for each other’s combat prowess. While Goose’s unbridled aggression contrasts with Slickback’s more disciplined approach, both warriors serve as vital assets to Primarch Kurgle. Slickback’s reaction times and brutal efficiency make him a valuable protector, while Goose’s raw combat ability makes him a powerful force on the battlefield. Though their personalities differ, their loyalty to Kurgle keeps them aligned.
