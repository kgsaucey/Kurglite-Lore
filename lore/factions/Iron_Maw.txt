IRON MAW

The Iron Maw was once a proud and loyal Chapter of Space Marines, known for their mastery of siege warfare. Under the leadership of Vorthas the Devourer, the Chapter fell to the worship of Khorne, the Chaos God of bloodshed and war. As they embraced the bloodlust of Khorne, the Iron Maw began waging war not just on the enemies of the Imperium, but on Imperial worlds themselves, offering blood and skulls to the Blood God.
The Chapter's tactics devolved into mindless slaughter, with their marines becoming berserkers who fought only for the thrill of bloodshed. Their emblem, once a symbol of their strength and tenacity, became a twisted representation of their fall from grace.
Captain Kurgle, recognizing the madness consuming the Iron Maw, gathered those still loyal to the Emperor and led a rebellion. In a swift and decisive coup, Kurgle eliminated Vorthas and the Chaos-corrupted leadership, purging the Chapter of heresy. After this victory, Kurgle renamed the Chapter to the Kurglites, restoring their honor and loyalty to the Emperor. The remnants of the Iron Maw fled into the Eye of Terror, becoming a Chaos warband that continues to plague the galaxy.

[REBELLION]

The Iron Maw Rebellion marked the end of the heretical leadership within the Chapter and the rise of Primarch Kurgle. As the Iron Maw fell further into the thrall of Khorne, their actions grew more erratic and bloodthirsty. Vorthas the Devourer led the Chapter into increasingly reckless campaigns, sacrificing Imperial worlds and citizens in the name of bloodshed.

Captain Kurgle, however, had not succumbed to the madness. Rallying those marines who still held true to the Emperor, Kurgle launched a rebellion against Vorthas and his lieutenants. Using his tactical genius, Kurgle struck at the heart of the Iron Maw’s leadership, eliminating Vorthas and his most loyal berserkers. The rebellion was brutal and swift, with Kurgle’s forces purging the Chaos-tainted leadership in a single decisive battle.
After the rebellion, Kurgle took command of the Chapter and renamed it the Kurglites, rejecting the blood-soaked legacy of the Iron Maw and restoring their loyalty to the Emperor. Under his leadership, the Kurglites became known for their discipline and calculated violence, far removed from the mindless bloodlust of their past.
The remnants of the Iron Maw, now little more than a bloodthirsty warband, fled into the Eye of Terror, where they continue to wage war in the name of Khorne, seeking revenge on Kurgle and his loyalists.
