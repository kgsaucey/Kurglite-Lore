### Rebellion
The downfall of the Iron Maw came to a head during the Horus Heresy. A tribunal convened to judge the loyalty of a returning warrior (Benedictus Thane) became the flashpoint for open conflict. The proceedings had been infiltrated by heretics, twisting the trial into a farce.  

Captain Kurgle, summoned in secret to investigate, uncovered and slew the conspirators. His actions, instead of being praised, drew the ire of Chapter Master Vorthas the Devourer, who had already given himself over to Horus and the blood-soaked path of Khorne.  

Condemned for his actions, rather than praised, Kurgle responded with decisive violence. Rallying those still loyal to the Emperor, he struck against the tribunal and citadel, purging the corruption at its heart. This act ignited the broader rebellion. Loyalists under Kurgle’s command clashed with the Chaos-tainted leadership, and in a brutal coup, Vorthas and his followers were destroyed.  

The Iron Maw fractured. Those loyal to the Emperor became the foundation of the Kurglites, while the remnants fled into the Eye of Terror, reduced to a blood-mad warband in service to Khorne.  

## Relations
Relations within the Iron Maw devolved into fanatic loyalty to Khorne, mindless bloodlust, and obedience to whichever warlord promised the most slaughter. Discipline and cohesion collapsed, replaced by a frenzy of violence and competition for skulls.  

## Structure & Layout
- **Companies:**  
  Once organized along Codex Astartes lines with a focus on siege companies, the Iron Maw abandoned structure after their fall. They now operate as a warband, broken into packs of berserkers united only by devotion to Khorne.  

- **Command Hierarchy:**  
  Under Vorthas the Devourer, leadership was enforced through fear and slaughter. After his death at Kurgle’s hands, surviving champions fight amongst themselves, with power shifting constantly based on strength and kills offered to Khorne.  

- **Specialist Formations:**  
  - **Berserker Warbands** — Blood-crazed squads of Marines driven to reckless charges.  
  - **Skull-Takers** — Warriors dedicated to ritual beheadings and offerings to Khorne.  
  - **Siege Breakers** — A lingering remnant of their loyalist past, these units twist siegecraft into crude but devastating assaults, preferring brute force over precision.  

- **Fleet Assets:**  
  Fled into the Eye of Terror. Maintain a scattered fleet of corrupted warships, raiding Imperial space for blood and skulls.  

- **Recruitment / Training:**  
  Discipline and initiation rites are gone, replaced by blood rites and gladiatorial trials. Aspirants and captives are forced into endless combat; only survivors drenched in blood are accepted into the warband.  

## Extra Notes
- Their emblem became a twisted representation of their fall from grace.
