### The Rebellion of Kurgle
During the Horus Heresy, the Iron Maw Chapter fell into the worship of Khorne under Vorthas the Devourer. Captain Kurgle rallied those still loyal to the Emperor and purged the traitors in a decisive rebellion. With the death of Vorthas, Kurgle renamed the Chapter the Kurglites, restoring loyalty to the Emperor and severing the blood-soaked legacy of the Iron Maw.  

### Ambush on Glaurus IV
On Glaurus IV, a Tyranid river-beast launched a sudden attack against the Primarch. Brother Slickback killed the creature before it reached Kurgle, reaffirming his role as the Primarch’s most trusted protector.
