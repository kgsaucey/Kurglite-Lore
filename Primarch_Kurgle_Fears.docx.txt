Primarch_Kurgle_Fears.docx
Primarch Kurgle harbors a secret fear of Zoanthropes, the Tyranid psykers known for their terrifying psychic abilities. This fear originates from an encounter during the campaign on Valthor IV, where a Zoanthrope’s psychic attack nearly overwhelmed him, forcing him to retreat—a moment that haunts him to this day. Though Kurgle never speaks of this fear, it remains a hidden vulnerability that he carefully guards, knowing that it could be exploited by his enemies.
Kurgle’s fear of Zoanthropes drives him to overprepare for psychic threats, diverting significant resources to ensure that such enemies are neutralized as quickly as possible. Though his inner circle may notice his caution, none would dare question the Primarch’s authority.
