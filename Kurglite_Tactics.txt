Kurglite_Tactics.docx
The Kurglite Chapter is known for its calculated approach to warfare, a direct reflection of Primarch Kurgle’s leadership. Unlike the reckless, bloodthirsty tactics of their predecessor, the Iron Maw, the Kurglites operate with discipline, precision, and strategic violence. The Chapter is revered for their ability to exploit their enemies’ weaknesses, dismantling opposing forces piece by piece.
Their tactics often revolve around siege warfare, a remnant of their original Chapter’s expertise, but with an added emphasis on calculated strikes. The Kurglites will often weaken enemy defenses over time, striking at opportune moments to deliver devastating blows. Primarch Kurgle insists on tactical patience, and his marines are trained to balance restraint with ruthlessness. While some units like Brother Goose excel in unbridled aggression, they are kept in check by the overarching strategy that Kurgle sets.
The Chapter is also known for their adaptability, with specialized units for various types of warfare, from shock assaults to long sieges. The Kurglite Honor Guard, in particular, is renowned for their defensive prowess, often tasked with protecting key assets and leadership figures, such as Kurgle himself.
