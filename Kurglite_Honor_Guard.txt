The Kurglite Honor Guard is an elite unit within the Chapter, tasked with protecting the Chapter’s most important assets and leaders, including Primarch Kurgle. The Honor Guard is composed of the most loyal and battle-hardened marines, chosen for their unwavering loyalty and effectiveness in battle.
Brother Slickback is a prominent figure within the Honor Guard, known for his brutal enforcement of discipline and his protective nature when it comes to the Chapter’s leadership. His swift reaction times and unparalleled combat efficiency make him one of Kurgle’s most trusted defenders. Brother Goose, with his unpredictable but powerful combat abilities, is also frequently deployed alongside the Honor Guard during high-risk missions.
The Honor Guard’s combat style emphasizes both defensive tactics and rapid counterattacks. While they specialize in holding critical positions, they are equally skilled at launching decisive strikes against threats. The combination of calculated defense and overwhelming offensive power makes the Kurglite Honor Guard one of the most feared units in the Chapter.
