Brother_Goose_Combat_Style.docx
Brother Goose is known for his unbridled aggression and fury in battle. His transformation into a humanoid with the head of a Canada goose only enhanced his combat abilities, making his reflexes sharper and his attacks more relentless.
In combat, Brother Goose relies on his instincts and raw strength, often launching himself into the heart of battle with little regard for his own safety. His rage-fueled attacks are devastating, allowing him to crush enemies with overwhelming force. Despite his fury, Goose is highly effective and tactical in his destruction, targeting weak points in enemy formations to break their defenses and cause maximum chaos.
Goose’s role in the Battle of Drakos Ridge is a routine example of his consistency as a capable commander. Leading a counterattack against the Tyranid vanguard, his relentless assault broke through the enemy lines, giving Luna the time she needed to solidify their defenses. Though his methods are brutal, Goose’s efficiency and dedication to the Kurglites make him a key figure in any battle.
