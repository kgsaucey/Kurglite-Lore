On the Riverbank of an Alien Shoreline
The world of Glaurus IV was a desolate and foreboding place, its atmosphere heavy with humidity and its lands dominated by twisted, unnatural flora. A vast river snaked through the alien landscape, its banks littered with jagged rocks and toxic vegetation. The Kurglites had been deployed to eliminate a lurking Tyranid threat, but the landscape itself was as much an enemy as the xenos creatures they hunted.
Primarch Kurgle and Brother Slickback walked the riverbank, the humid air thick with the stench of decay. Kurgle, calm and calculating as ever, scanned the area with cold eyes. His mission here was to assess the Tyranid infestation and determine how best to eradicate it. Slickback followed close behind, his left gauntlet—a deep purple and infamous for its brutal backhand—gleaming faintly in the dim light.
The eerie silence was shattered when, without warning, a massive river raptor—a variant of the Tyranid adapted to the planet’s rivers—burst from the water with terrifying speed. Its body was covered in sleek, oily scales, and its claws, dripping with venom, were poised to strike. The beast hurtled toward Kurgle, its maw wide open, aiming for the back of the Primarch.
Brother Slickback reacted in an instant.
Without hesitation, he threw himself at the raptor, tackling it mid-air with the full force of his power-armored body. The two slammed into the rocky shoreline, the raptor’s claws scraping against Slickback’s armor, sending sparks flying as they tumbled into the jagged rocks. The creature thrashed wildly, its serpentine form twisting as it tried to sink its fangs into Slickback’s helmet.
But Brother Slickback was relentless.
He planted his knee firmly into the creature’s throat, pinning it down, and raised his dark purple gauntlet. With a savage roar, he delivered a crushing backhand blow to the raptor’s skull, the force of the strike reverberating through its body. The raptor’s head cracked open like brittle stone, its body twitching as its life force drained away into the blood-soaked rocks.
Even as the raptor’s corpse lay motionless, Slickback did not relent. He wrenched the beast’s head from its body with a vicious pull, holding it aloft for a moment as he glanced toward Kurgle, who had calmly turned to witness the aftermath of the ambush.
Primarch Kurgle observed the scene with his usual detached calm. His wide, amphibian eyes blinked slowly as he surveyed the mangled remains of the raptor at Slickback’s feet. He gave a slight nod of approval, acknowledging the efficiency and speed with which his Honor Guard had dealt with the threat.
"Well struck, Brother," Kurgle’s voice croaked, his tone carrying both a rare hint of gratitude and an underlying expectation that such loyalty was standard among his warriors.
Slickback, still gripping the raptor’s severed head in his left hand, gave a curt nod in return. "For the Emperor, and for you, Primarch." His voice was as hard as the rocky shoreline beneath him.
Without another word, Slickback discarded the raptor’s head into the river, where it was quickly carried away by the swift current, a fitting end for a xenos that had dared to strike at the First Second-Born.
They resumed their path along the riverbank, the brief ambush only serving as a reminder of the constant dangers they faced. But for Brother Slickback, it was a reaffirmation of his role—to serve, protect, and enforce with ruthless precision. In this moment, he had once again proven why Primarch Kurgle trusted him with his life.
