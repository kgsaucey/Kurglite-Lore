The Massacre on Vostoria Prime was a decisive and chilling demonstration of Damian’s methods. Vostoria Prime, once a thriving industrial world within the Imperium, had descended into chaos as heretical cults pledged to Chaos spread rebellion across the planet. The Imperial forces were overwhelmed, and in desperation, the surviving loyalists sent a plea to the Kurglites. Instead of a fleet, the response came in the form of a single man: Damian, son of Primarch Kurgle, known as The Cheerful Butcher.
Primarch Kurgle sent Damian alone to eliminate the heretical leadership. Damian’s mission was clear—eradicate the key figures who had led the planet into ruin and pledged themselves to Chaos. His father trusted Damian's terrifying precision and efficiency, knowing the task could be completed with a single man. As Damian descended onto Vostoria Prime in his dropship, he observed the industrial wasteland that the planet had become, its once-proud towers now monuments to decay, with heretical banners fluttering in the toxic air.
Clad in his dark green power armor, Damian set out alone, with no fanfare, and no witnesses. His first target was the Vox Spire, a massive communication tower used by the cult leaders to spread their blasphemous sermons across the planet. Moving under the cover of darkness, Damian infiltrated the spire using his mastery of technology to bypass defenses and confuse his enemies. Inside, the cult leaders were gathered, celebrating their perceived victory. With clinical precision, Damian disabled the power core, plunging the tower into darkness, before eliminating the leaders one by one in brutal silence. Their bodies lay crumpled at his feet, but there was no one to witness his cold efficiency or the unsettling smile that crossed his face as he observed the destruction he had wrought.
His next target was the heretical fortress where the remaining cult leaders had barricaded themselves. This time, the strike required more than stealth—it was a display of sheer ruthlessness. Damian deactivated the fortress’s defenses, including its life support systems, condemning the heretics inside to suffocation. As they scrambled in panic, trying to restore power, Damian watched with a calm, calculating gaze. Those who tried to flee were met with his blade, cut down swiftly and without hesitation. The fortress fell into silence, with no trace of life remaining.
Once his mission was complete, Damian left behind a grim reminder. The bodies of the heretical leaders were impaled on the fortress’s highest spire, a chilling warning to any who dared defy the Emperor. The massacre was absolute—Vostoria Prime’s rebellion was not merely defeated; it was erased from existence. Though no one lived to see it, Damian’s unnerving curiosity toward the aftermath, his calm efficiency, and his eerie fascination with the devastation marked him as one of the most feared enforcers of Kurglite law.
