Brother_Goose_Relationships.docx
Brother Goose’s relationship with Primarch Kurgle is one of deep respect and loyalty. Having fought alongside Kurgle during the anti-heresy campaigns as a member of the Carcharodons, Goose developed a strong bond with him. This trust was solidified during Kurgle’s rebellion against the Iron Maw leadership, where Goose stood by him as one of the first to join the uprising.
Goose’s rage-driven nature complements Kurgle’s calm and strategic leadership. While Kurgle values precision and discipline, Goose provides the raw aggression needed to overwhelm enemies in combat. Together, they form a balanced and fearsome team, capable of handling both tactical and brute-force challenges.
Goose also has a strong bond with Luna, particularly due to her more empathetic side. While Goose is known for his fury in battle, Luna’s compassion creates a calming influence around him, allowing him to respect her leadership without the same tension he might feel with other commanders.
