The Iron Maw Rebellion marked the end of the heretical leadership within the Chapter and the rise of Primarch Kurgle. As the Iron Maw fell further into the thrall of Khorne, their actions grew more erratic and bloodthirsty. Vorthas the Devourer led the Chapter into increasingly reckless campaigns, sacrificing Imperial worlds and citizens in the name of bloodshed.
Captain Kurgle, however, had not succumbed to the madness. Rallying those marines who still held true to the Emperor, Kurgle launched a rebellion against Vorthas and his lieutenants. Using his tactical genius, Kurgle struck at the heart of the Iron Maw’s leadership, eliminating Vorthas and his most loyal berserkers. The rebellion was brutal and swift, with Kurgle’s forces purging the Chaos-tainted leadership in a single decisive battle.
After the rebellion, Kurgle took command of the Chapter and renamed it the Kurglites, rejecting the blood-soaked legacy of the Iron Maw and restoring their loyalty to the Emperor. Under his leadership, the Kurglites became known for their discipline and calculated violence, far removed from the mindless bloodlust of their past.
The remnants of the Iron Maw, now little more than a bloodthirsty warband, fled into the Eye of Terror, where they continue to wage war in the name of Khorne, seeking revenge on Kurgle and his loyalists.
