Primarch Kurgle Physical Appearance
Primarch Kurgle stands as an imposing figure, towering over his fellow marines. His armor is an imposing blend of dark green and black, with intricate gold trim adorning his chest plate and pauldrons. His left pauldron bears the emblem of the Kurglites, a symbol of calculated violence and discipline. Kurgle’s face is stern, his features marked by deep scars from countless battles.
However, the most unique aspect of Kurgle’s appearance is his frog-like head, a result of ancient experimentation that fused human traits with amphibian characteristics. Despite the unusual mutation, Kurgle's cold, calculating eyes show no sign of weakness. He carries a mighty relic blade that gleams with energy, signifying his authority as the First Second-Born Primarch.

Brother Goose Physical Appearance
Brother Goose, once known as Bryanaris, is a fearsome figure to behold after his warp mutation. His body remains that of a well-armored Space Marine, clad in the Kurglite colors of faded light green, but his head has transformed into that of a Canada goose. The mutation has given him heightened reflexes, but his new appearance makes him unsettling to behold.
His armor is heavily worn from countless battles, but it is meticulously maintained. His beady goose eyes are filled with rage when he enters combat, and his honking battle cries are legendary among the Chapter. Goose carries a massive power sword and bolter, both tailored to his aggressive, head-on fighting style.

Brother Slickback Physical Appearance
Brother Slickback is known for his distinct, intimidating appearance. His power armor is primarily faded light green, but his left gauntlet is a deep purple, a signature of his feared backhand strikes. This gauntlet is encrusted with gems, giving it an ominous, otherworldly appearance that strikes fear into both allies and enemies.
Slickback’s armor is adorned with battle scars, and hanging from his pauldron by a red sash is the skull of a small child, a grim reminder of his brutal enforcement of discipline. His bolter is a metallic silver, designed for precision. Though not overly observant or meticulous, Slickback’s reaction times are unmatched, making him one of the most effective enforcers within the Chapter.

Luna Physical Appearance
Luna is striking in her custom armor, which reflects her dual nature as both a ruthless commander and an empathetic leader. Her armor is primarily dark gray with silver accents, and her light brown hair flows freely down her back during combat. Her eyes are sharp, yet they hold a compassion that few others in the Kurglite Chapter possess.
Her weapons include a plasma pistol and a power sword, both finely crafted to suit her strategic style of fighting. Despite the wear and tear of countless battles, Luna’s armor retains a level of refinement and elegance, a testament to her meticulous care and her role as a respected leader in the Chapter.

Damian Physical Appearance
Damian, known as The Cheerful Butcher, has a striking and unnerving appearance. His armor is dark green with black highlights, meticulously maintained to reflect his obsession with technology and efficiency. His face, however, is where the real unease lies—he wears a constant, childlike smile, even in the midst of battle. This smile, coupled with his disturbing curiosity toward violence, gives him a disquieting aura.
Damian's weapons are advanced, with custom modifications suited to his technological expertise. He wields a bolter and a variety of mechanized tools, perfect for dismantling enemies with surgical precision. His overall demeanor, combined with his grim smile, makes him one of the most feared figures within the Kurglite Chapter.
