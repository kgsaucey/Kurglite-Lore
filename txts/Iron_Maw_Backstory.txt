Iron_Maw_Backstory.docx
The Iron Maw was once a proud and loyal Chapter of Space Marines, known for their mastery of siege warfare. Under the leadership of Vorthas the Devourer, the Chapter fell to the worship of Khorne, the Chaos God of bloodshed and war. As they embraced the bloodlust of Khorne, the Iron Maw began waging war not just on the enemies of the Imperium, but on Imperial worlds themselves, offering blood and skulls to the Blood God.
The Chapter's tactics devolved into mindless slaughter, with their marines becoming berserkers who fought only for the thrill of bloodshed. Their emblem, once a symbol of their strength and tenacity, became a twisted representation of their fall from grace.
Captain Kurgle, recognizing the madness consuming the Iron Maw, gathered those still loyal to the Emperor and led a rebellion. In a swift and decisive coup, Kurgle eliminated Vorthas and the Chaos-corrupted leadership, purging the Chapter of heresy. After this victory, Kurgle renamed the Chapter to the Kurglites, restoring their honor and loyalty to the Emperor. The remnants of the Iron Maw fled into the Eye of Terror, becoming a Chaos warband that continues to plague the galaxy.
