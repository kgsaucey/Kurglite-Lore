The Rebellion of Kurgle
Primarch Kurgle, The Ascended, led a rebellion against the corrupted leadership of the Iron Maw Chapter, which had fallen to the worship of Khorne under the leadership of Vorthas the Devourer. The rebellion was swift and brutal, with Kurgle purging the Chapter of its heretical elements. After the defeat of Vorthas, Kurgle renamed the Chapter to the Kurglites, restoring their loyalty to the Emperor.
