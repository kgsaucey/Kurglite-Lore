Damian

Damian, known as The Cheerful Butcher, is the son of Primarch Kurgle. From a young age, Damian showed a strong affinity for technology and ruthless methods in achieving his objectives. His ability to remain cold and focused in battle, followed by an unsettlingly cheerful demeanor after the carnage, earned him this title. Before earning the honor of serving with his father’s Chapter, Damian sought to prove himself elsewhere. He joined the Ultramarines shortly after his sister Luna was sworn in as a junior Inquisitor.
During combat, Damian’s demeanor becomes cold and focused, displaying an unsettling efficiency. However, once the violence subsides, his unnervingly cheerful disposition emerges. Damian often exhibits a childlike smile, curiously observing the destruction he has caused. This eerie contrast between his detached efficiency in battle and his fascination with the aftermath has earned him both fear and respect within the Chapter.
After proving his worth in key battles, Damian was summoned back to the Kurglite fortress by his father, Kurgle. Once back with the Kurglites, Damian was entrusted with overseeing the Chapter’s Dreadnoughts and managing the wounded marines being interred into the Dreadnoughts. His disturbing fascination with violence, combined with his technological expertise, made him both a vital asset and a figure of concern within the Chapter.
One of Damian’s most infamous moments came during the Massacre on Vostoria Prime, where he single-handedly eliminated a Chaos cult. Moving with methodical precision, he deactivated life support systems and executed the survivors. In the silence that followed, Damian’s unsettling smile and curious observation of the carnage would have left an indelible mark—had there been anyone to witness it. His reputation as one of the most feared and disturbing enforcers of Kurglite law was solidified by the complete erasure of the heretics, both physically and in records.

[RELATIONSHIPS]

Damian’s relationships within the Kurglites are marked by respect, discipline, and loyalty. Though his nature differs from his sister Luna’s, their bond remains strong through shared loyalty to their father and the Chapter.
Primarch Kurgle: As Kurgle’s son, Damian holds a special place within the Chapter. Kurgle respects Damian’s unsettling but effective methods, entrusting him with overseeing the Dreadnought program and placing him in charge of critical technological operations. Though Kurgle acknowledges that Damian's methods are brutal, they align with his own strategic and disciplined nature.
Luna: Damian’s relationship with his sister Luna is built on mutual respect, though their approaches differ greatly. Where Damian is cold and calculated, with a disturbing comfort in violence, Luna’s compassionate side makes her more relatable to those she commands. Nonetheless, Damian trusts Luna’s battlefield prowess, and they share a strong familial bond.
Brother Goose and Brother Slickback: Damian interacts primarily with Luna and Kurgle, but his role as a disciplinarian and enforcer aligns with both Goose’s unbridled aggression and Slickback’s strict enforcement of Chapter law.
