# Brother Goose

## Overview
Brother Goose — mutated warrior of the Kurglites, originally Sergeant Bryanaris of the Carcharodons.  

## Appearance
Humanoid form with the head of a Canada goose, mutated during a warp storm on Tharonis IV.  

## Personality
Ferocious, unbridled aggression in combat, balanced by loyalty and camaraderie.  

## Background
Before becoming Brother Goose, Bryanaris served as a Sergeant in the Carcharodons Chapter. During several anti-heresy campaigns, Bryanaris worked side by side with a young Lt. Kurgle, forging a bond through their shared experiences in battling heretics. These campaigns proved formative for both warriors, building a foundation of trust and respect between them.  
When Kurgle rebelled against the corrupted leadership of the Iron Maw, Bryanaris—still loyal to the Emperor—was one of the first to support him. His loyalty, combat expertise, and shared history with Kurgle made him a crucial ally in the rebellion. With Kurgle’s strategic guidance, Bryanaris helped in the swift and brutal overthrow of the Chaos-tainted leadership.  
After the successful rebellion and the formation of the Kurglites, Bryanaris continued to serve under Kurgle. However, his transformation into Brother Goose occurred during a warp storm on the planet Tharonis IV, where his squad was caught in a chaotic rift. The warp energy mutated Bryanaris, turning him into a humanoid with the head of a Canada goose. Despite the transformation, Bryanaris retained his fierce loyalty to Kurgle and the Emperor, earning the new name Brother Goose.  
Though known for his ferocity, Brother Goose has been involved in routine moments of camaraderie, such as the occasional War Room Tussle with Kurgle and Brother Slickback—a playful yet intense demonstration of their preexisting bond.  

## Abilities & Gear
### Combat Style
Brother Goose is known for his unbridled aggression and fury in battle. His transformation into a humanoid with the head of a Canada goose only enhanced his combat abilities, making his reflexes sharper and his attacks more relentless.  
In combat, Brother Goose relies on his instincts and raw strength, often launching himself into the heart of battle with little regard for his own safety. His rage-fueled attacks are devastating, allowing him to crush enemies with overwhelming force. Despite his fury, Goose is highly effective and tactical in his destruction, targeting weak points in enemy formations to break their defenses and cause maximum chaos.  
Goose’s role in the Battle of Drakos Ridge is a routine example of his consistency as a capable commander. Leading a counterattack against the Tyranid vanguard, his relentless assault broke through the enemy lines, giving Luna the time she needed to solidify their defenses. Though his methods are brutal, Goose’s efficiency and dedication to the Kurglites make him a key figure in any battle.  

## Relationships
Brother Goose’s relationship with Primarch Kurgle is one of deep respect and loyalty. Having fought alongside Kurgle during the anti-heresy campaigns as a member of the Carcharodons, Goose developed a strong bond with him. This trust was solidified during Kurgle’s rebellion against the Iron Maw leadership, where Goose stood by him as one of the first to join the uprising.  
Goose’s rage-driven nature complements Kurgle’s calm and strategic leadership. While Kurgle values precision and discipline, Goose provides the raw aggression needed to overwhelm enemies in combat. Together, they form a balanced and fearsome team, capable of handling both tactical and brute-force challenges.  
Goose also has a strong bond with Luna, particularly due to her more empathetic side. While Goose is known for his fury in battle, Luna’s compassion creates a calming influence around him, allowing him to respect her leadership without the same tension he might feel with other commanders.
