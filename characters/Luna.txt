Luna, daughter of Primarch Kurgle, rose to prominence within the Kurglites at a young age. Known for her calculated leadership and tactical brilliance, Luna has always stood out from her peers for her ability to balance ruthlessness in battle with a more compassionate approach to leadership. Her rise to Inquisitor came after her decisive role in the Battle of Drakos Ridge, where she successfully defended the ridge against a Tyranid swarm, earning her the title and the respect of her father and peers.
Despite her fierce nature on the battlefield, Luna’s personality contrasts with the typical brutal demeanor of the Kurglites. She is empathetic toward her subordinates, understanding their struggles and mentoring them with a degree of compassion that few others in the Chapter exhibit. This softer side is seen by some as a strength and by others, like Brother Slickback, as a potential weakness.
Luna often alternates between moments of intense, driven focus during emergencies and times of distraction in calmer, low-stress situations. In battle or moments of crisis, Luna’s decision-making becomes razor-sharp, allowing her to excel under pressure. However, in more relaxed environments, her mind can wander, leading to occasional lapses in focus. Despite these characteristics, she remains a trusted tool of the Kurglite Chapter, executing her father’s will without concern for failure.
