Secret fear of Zoanthropes  

### FEARS
Primarch Kurgle harbors a secret fear of Zoanthropes, the Tyranid psykers known for their terrifying psychic abilities. This fear originates from an encounter during the campaign on Valthor IV, where a Zoanthrope’s psychic attack nearly overwhelmed him, forcing him to retreat—a moment that haunts him to this day. Though Kurgle never speaks of this fear, it remains a hidden vulnerability that he carefully guards, knowing that it could be exploited by his enemies.  
Kurgle’s fear of Zoanthropes drives him to overprepare for psychic threats, diverting significant resources to ensure that such enemies are neutralized as quickly as possible. Though his inner circle may notice his caution, none would dare question the Primarch’s authority.  

## Background
Primarch Kurgle, The Ascended, was once a loyal Captain within the Iron Maw, a Chapter renowned for its siege tactics and ferocity. Under the leadership of Vorthas the Devourer, the Chapter fell into madness, embracing the worship of Khorne. As the Iron Maw became consumed by bloodlust and mindless slaughter, Kurgle realized the Chapter was spiraling into heresy.  
In response, Kurgle gathered those marines who remained loyal to the Emperor. Leading a covert rebellion from within, Kurgle and his loyalists launched a decisive strike against the Chaos-corrupted leadership. His brilliant tactics allowed him to outmaneuver and eliminate Vorthas and his inner circle, purging the Chapter of heresy.  
Following the successful rebellion, Kurgle renamed the Chapter to the Kurglites, casting off the tainted legacy of the Iron Maw and restoring their loyalty to the Emperor. As The Ascended, Kurgle has since led the Kurglites with cold precision, instilling discipline and order where once there was madness.  
However, during a campaign on Valthor IV, Kurgle had a harrowing encounter with a Zoanthrope. The psychic assault nearly overwhelmed him, forcing Kurgle to retreat for the first time in his career. This experience left him with a deep, unspoken fear of Zoanthropes, though he keeps this vulnerability hidden from all but his most trusted allies.  
Though a disciplined and serious leader, Kurgle has shared lighter moments with his closest companions, such as during the War Room Tussle, where he engaged in a routine sparring match with Brother Goose and Brother Slickback. These playful bouts serve as a simple reminder of the camaraderie between them, built over years of shared experience.
