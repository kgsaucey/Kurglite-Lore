# GPT Instructions – Character Files

- Do **not** change or expand narrative content of character files.  
- Only add or enforce headers for organization.  
- Keep all content verbatim.  

## Standard Headers (in order):  
1. **Overview** — short framing summary (character name, title, role). Do not place long narrative here.  
2. **Appearance**  
3. **Personality** (include fears or quirks if explicitly labeled)  
4. **Background** — place all long-form narrative history here.  
5. **Abilities & Gear** (include leadership style, combat methods, tactics, etc.)  
6. **Relationships**  
7. **Story Notes** — leave blank unless adding forward-looking notes. Do not put past events here.  
8. **Extra Categories** — create only if content cannot be assigned to the above.  

## Additional Rules
- If a section has no content, mark it `[Empty]`.  
- Do not compress, fold, or rephrase content to make it fit.  
- Do not create a “Current Status” section.  
- Place any “title” or role identifiers in **Overview**.  
- When sections are explicitly labeled in the source (e.g. `[FEARS]`, `[LEADERSHIP STRATEGY]`), preserve them as subsections under the most fitting standard header.
