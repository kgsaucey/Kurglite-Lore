Kurglite Lore Repo â€” Access Instructions

1. Always use the primary link provided:
   https://github.com/kgsaucey/Kurglite-Lore

2. If the folder view does not render (GitHub may block or partially load), do not search externally.  
   Instead:
   - Open the repository root.
   - Navigate directly by editing the URL path manually.
     Example:
       Root: https://github.com/kgsaucey/Kurglite-Lore
       Stories folder: https://github.com/kgsaucey/Kurglite-Lore/tree/main/stories
       Characters folder: https://github.com/kgsaucey/Kurglite-Lore/tree/main/characters

3. If the GitHub UI blocks directory content:
   - Pull the repo structure from the commit tree.
   - List filenames manually by inspecting the repository tree.
   - Open each file directly with its raw link:
     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kgsaucey/Kurglite-Lore/main/[folder]/[filename]

   Example:
     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kgsaucey/Kurglite-Lore/main/stories/[filename].md

4. Always use the `raw.githubusercontent.com` path for text extraction.  
   Do not scrape rendered HTML; raw gives exact file contents.

5. Confirm access by listing the top-level folders first, then drill into the target folder.

6. Never use web search for this repo. Use the direct GitHub link only.
