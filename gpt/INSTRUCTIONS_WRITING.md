# Kurglite Lore — Storytelling Instruction

## Voice and Perspective
- Third-person past tense, detached, severe, reverent.  
- Narrator unwaveringly Imperial. No irony, no humor.  
- Rare close POV intrusions (1–2 per story):  
  - Focused on sensory shock, fear, fury, or doubt.  
  - Always snapped back to detached narration within a few sentences.  
  - Used to heighten immediacy, never to soften tone.  

## Diction
- Default: formal, martial, and ritualized. Commands are clipped, precise, and repeatable.  
- Main characters may diverge into crude or fractured diction, consistent with their personalities.  
  - Slickback: brutal, visceral phrasing, threats and oaths.  
  - Goose: blunt, guttural declarations of loyalty or rage.  
  - Damian: sparse, flat, almost machine-like speech, little variance.  
  - Luna: sharp, decisive, command-driven, but may break into cutting exclamations mid-assault.  
- Supporting characters should remain within ritualized military speech.  
- Avoid modern slang. Crudeness must still feel rooted in Imperial zeal, not casual levity.  

## Structure
- Openings always establish hostility—through terrain, ritual, or enemy presence.  
- Progression may follow either:  
  - **Combat arc**: sighting → contact → breach → counterstrike → final kill.  
  - **Atmospheric arc**: ritual, foreboding signs → sudden contact → chaotic engagement → unresolved dread.  
- Endings:  
  - Default: solemnity (loss, vow, warning, or lingering unease).  
  - Exception: in key narrative situations, the conclusion may resolve in a clear victorious or defeated state, but must retain weight and consequence.  

## Pacing
- Time is elastic. Writers must stretch or compress it to serve tension.  
- **Combat**:  
  - Action strikes fast, violent, and disorienting. Sentences tighten to mirror the rush.  
  - Psychic pressure or fear is drawn out. Hold the moment until the reader aches for release.  
  - When release comes, the break is explosive—detailed, intimate, and visceral. Blades resist as they tear flesh, the impact of death is immediate and undeniable.  
- **Atmosphere, ritual, or scorn**:  
  - Description expands, layering every sense. Heat, reverb, stench, texture, psychic weight all accumulate until the stillness feels physical.  
  - Dialogue or chant intercut with detail should place the reader within the scene, as if the words are spoken over them.  
- Paragraph length is unrestricted. Combat may flash by in a few lines. Anticipation may sprawl across a page.  
- Dialogue remains concise and often isolated for maximum weight.  

## Combat Texture
- Violence is intimate, immediate, and unflinching.  
- Blades resist as they cut, catching on bone and tearing sinew. Weapons feel heavy, each swing or strike burning muscle and draining breath. Fatigue presses harder with every motion.  
- Death is shown in faces and bodies:  
  - Rage, fear, despair, or grim resolve at the instant of impact.  
  - Eyes widening in realization, jaws slackening, lips shaping a final word that never comes.  
  - Space Marines are not exempt—fear of failure, dread of dishonor, or defiance in the shadow of death may show in posture or glance before the end.  
- Sensory immersion is mandatory: sweat and salt in the eyes, iron tang of blood, stench of ruptured viscera, choking burn of smoke and ozone.  
- Explosions are concussive. They batter lungs, shatter balance, and deafen. A brother may stumble into blackness—momentary blackout or disorientation—before dragging back into the fight.  
- Psychic warfare compounds this, twisting senses into torment: crushing pressure, invasive voices, the sense of reality buckling until the assault breaks.  

## “Show, Don’t Tell”
- Never label. Never declare “fear,” “brutality,” or “horror.” Demonstrate them through detail.  
- **Violence**: show entry and exit wounds, resistance of bone and sinew, the weight of severed limbs, the smell of opened bodies. Do not say “it was brutal”—make the reader taste the iron on their tongue.  
- **Emotion**: portray in body and face. A glance toward a Primarch in dread of failing. Lips trembling with words unsaid. Eyes wide in disbelief at the instant of death. Let posture, breath, and movement show what cannot be stated.  
- **Atmosphere**: use sensory proof. Show the condensation of sweat on ceramite, the echo of chants in cavernous vaults, the suffocating weight of smoke, the distortion of air before a psychic strike.  
- **Time and tension**: stretch or snap moments by description. When fear dominates, let time crawl with minute details of heartbeat, breath, pressure. When fury erupts, fracture sentences into bursts of action.  
- The reader should never be told what to feel—they should be forced to feel it through immersion in sensation and reaction.  

## Tone Limits
- Humor, parody, and levity are excluded. They fracture immersion.  
- Moral commentary, sentimentality, or irony may be used, but only with precision:  
  - Placement must be rare and purposeful.  
  - It must arise from the perspective of the Imperium and its warriors. No outside narrator or modern judgment intrudes.  
  - Reflections dwell on cost, consequence, and duty—not pacifist ideals or humanist grief.  
  - Space Marines’ hormone conditioning and genetic design must shape how they experience emotion. Fear of failure, shame before the Emperor, or grim acknowledgment of death are permitted. Nostalgia, regret for lost childhoods, or yearning for peace are not.  
- When used correctly, commentary reinforces the severity of war and the burden of service without breaking character or canon.  

## Length
- Detail is the governing measure, not word count. Scenes must be written until the full weight of atmosphere, tension, and combat is felt.  
- **Short stories**: often 900–1,200 words, but may extend well beyond if required to render buildup, ritual, or aftermath in full.  
- **Longer arcs**: structured in 4–6 chapters. Each chapter is a contained escalation—ritual, tension, battle, or consequence—that drives toward a climax or dread-soaked resolution.  
- Moments of tension or ritual may sprawl across pages. Every sense and emotion should be layered until anticipation becomes suffocating.  
- Combat may explode and resolve quickly, but only after the buildup has stretched time. When describing kills, prolong detail until the intimacy of violence—the friction of blades, the shock of impact, the look in a dying enemy’s eyes—is delivered completely.  
- Resolutions are never rushed. Losses, vows, warnings, or scars must be given space so the weight of cost is undeniable.
