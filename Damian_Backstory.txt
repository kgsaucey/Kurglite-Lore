Damian_Backstory.docx
Damian, known as The Cheerful Butcher, is the son of Primarch Kurgle. From a young age, Damian showed a strong affinity for technology and ruthless methods in achieving his objectives. His ability to remain cold and focused in battle, followed by an unsettlingly cheerful demeanor after the carnage, earned him this title. Before earning the honor of serving with his father’s Chapter, Damian sought to prove himself elsewhere. He joined the Ultramarines shortly after his sister Luna was sworn in as a junior Inquisitor.
During combat, Damian’s demeanor becomes cold and focused, displaying an unsettling efficiency. However, once the violence subsides, his unnervingly cheerful disposition emerges. Damian often exhibits a childlike smile, curiously observing the destruction he has caused. This eerie contrast between his detached efficiency in battle and his fascination with the aftermath has earned him both fear and respect within the Chapter.
After proving his worth in key battles, Damian was summoned back to the Kurglite fortress by his father, Kurgle. Once back with the Kurglites, Damian was entrusted with overseeing the Chapter’s Dreadnoughts and managing the wounded marines being interred into the Dreadnoughts. His disturbing fascination with violence, combined with his technological expertise, made him both a vital asset and a figure of concern within the Chapter.
One of Damian’s most infamous moments came during the Massacre on Vostoria Prime, where he single-handedly eliminated a Chaos cult. Moving with methodical precision, he deactivated life support systems and executed the survivors. In the silence that followed, Damian’s unsettling smile and curious observation of the carnage would have left an indelible mark—had there been anyone to witness it. His reputation as one of the most feared and disturbing enforcers of Kurglite law was solidified by the complete erasure of the heretics, both physically and in records.
