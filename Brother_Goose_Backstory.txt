Brother_Goose_Backstory.docx
Before becoming Brother Goose, Bryanaris served as a Sergeant in the Carcharodons Chapter. During several anti-heresy campaigns, Bryanaris worked side by side with a young Lt. Kurgle, forging a bond through their shared experiences in battling heretics. These campaigns proved formative for both warriors, building a foundation of trust and respect between them.
When Kurgle rebelled against the corrupted leadership of the Iron Maw, Bryanaris—still loyal to the Emperor—was one of the first to support him. His loyalty, combat expertise, and shared history with Kurgle made him a crucial ally in the rebellion. With Kurgle’s strategic guidance, Bryanaris helped in the swift and brutal overthrow of the Chaos-tainted leadership.
After the successful rebellion and the formation of the Kurglites, Bryanaris continued to serve under Kurgle. However, his transformation into Brother Goose occurred during a warp storm on the planet Tharonis IV, where his squad was caught in a chaotic rift. The warp energy mutated Bryanaris, turning him into a humanoid with the head of a Canada goose. Despite the transformation, Bryanaris retained his fierce loyalty to Kurgle and the Emperor, earning the new name Brother Goose.
Though known for his ferocity, Brother Goose has been involved in routine moments of camaraderie, such as the occasional War Room Tussle with Kurgle and Brother Slickback—a playful yet intense demonstration of their preexisting bond.
