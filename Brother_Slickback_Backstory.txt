Brother_Slickback_Backstory.docx
Not much is known about Brother Slickback's history prior to joining the Kurglites, as most of his service records are heavily redacted. It is clear, however, that he was a disciplined and highly skilled marine even before being inducted into the Chapter. He was brought into the Kurglites after Kurgle’s rebellion against the Iron Maw, though his service during this time remains a mystery.
After several successful campaigns within the Kurglites' 2nd Battle Company, Slickback was handpicked to join the elite Kurglite Honor Guard, an honor reserved only for the most loyal and brutal warriors. Known for his intense loyalty to Primarch Kurgle, Brother Slickback earned his reputation as a feared disciplinarian. His dark purple gauntlet—used in ferocious backhand strikes—became an infamous symbol of his enforcement of the Chapter’s rigid discipline.
One of Brother Slickback’s defining moments came on the planet Glaurus IV, where he saved Primarch Kurgle from a river raptor Tyranid ambush. Tackling the creature into the rocky shoreline, Slickback crushed its skull with a single strike from his dark purple gauntlet, reaffirming his place as Kurgle’s trusted protector.
Outside of battle, Slickback occasionally participates in routine moments of camaraderie with Kurgle and Brother Goose, such as the War Room Tussle, a sparring match that reflects their long-standing friendship and familiarity with one another.
