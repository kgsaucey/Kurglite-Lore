Brother_Slickback_Reputation.docx
Brother Slickback’s reputation as a brutal disciplinarian is well known throughout the Kurglite Chapter. While he is not known for being particularly observant or meticulous, his reaction times in battle are unparalleled. His ability to instantly respond to danger or disobedience has made him both feared and respected within the Chapter.
Slickback’s signature move is a backhand strike delivered with his dark purple gauntlet, a technique that has earned him countless victories in combat and ensured strict adherence to Kurgle’s commands. His dedication to enforcing Kurgle’s will has made him one of the most feared enforcers within the Chapter, and his loyalty to Kurgle is unquestionable.
Despite his ruthless nature, Slickback’s role as a protector was cemented when he saved Primarch Kurgle from a Tyranid ambush on Glaurus IV, crushing the creature’s skull with a single strike. This event only further solidified Slickback’s reputation as Kurgle’s most reliable and loyal defender.
