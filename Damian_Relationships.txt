Damian_Relationships.docx
Damian’s relationships within the Kurglites are marked by respect, discipline, and loyalty. Though his nature differs from his sister Luna’s, their bond remains strong through shared loyalty to their father and the Chapter.
Primarch Kurgle: As Kurgle’s son, Damian holds a special place within the Chapter. Kurgle respects Damian’s unsettling but effective methods, entrusting him with overseeing the Dreadnought program and placing him in charge of critical technological operations. Though Kurgle acknowledges that Damian's methods are brutal, they align with his own strategic and disciplined nature.
Luna: Damian’s relationship with his sister Luna is built on mutual respect, though their approaches differ greatly. Where Damian is cold and calculated, with a disturbing comfort in violence, Luna’s compassionate side makes her more relatable to those she commands. Nonetheless, Damian trusts Luna’s battlefield prowess, and they share a strong familial bond.
Brother Goose and Brother Slickback: Damian interacts primarily with Luna and Kurgle, but his role as a disciplinarian and enforcer aligns with both Goose’s unbridled aggression and Slickback’s strict enforcement of Chapter law.
