Brother Slickback’s power armor is a modified version of the standard Space Marine armor, adorned with faded light green tones characteristic of the Kurglites. What makes Slickback stand out, however, is his distinct dark purple gauntlet on his left hand. This gauntlet, a brutal tool of enforcement, has earned him a reputation for delivering devastating backhand strikes to his enemies—and sometimes even to those within the Chapter who fail to meet Kurgle’s high standards.
In addition to his purple gauntlet, Brother Slickback carries a metallic silver bolter, a highly customized firearm known for its precision and power. Hanging from his pauldron by a red sash is the skull of a small child, a grim reminder of the uncompromising nature of the Kurglites. His armor is adorned with a variety of small relics, tokens of battles past, that further solidify his fearsome reputation.
